# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This application allows the user to automatically generate an HTML file to be used as the source for a webpage which contains profiles for each of the user's team members at work. The user will be prompted with a series of questions, beginning with the specifics of their team manager. From there, the user will be able to specify whether they want to add additional Engineers, Interns, or exit from the prompt and generate the HTML file. The user can add as many Engineers or Interns as they please.

## Future Improvements

This app is currently very specific in terms of which types of employees are included. One potential improvement would be to add classes for additional employee roles, such as Designer, UX Researcher, Program Manager, etc. Another improvement would be to add some more flare to the HTML itself, as it's rather plain as it is now.
